            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                I was born into a small family in 1996. I am the second son to a mechanic and a cleaner. Two years later my parents collaborated again and my sister was born. 
                I grew up in small town in rural Queensland where the main industry is sugar cane, mangoes, and cattle. Being the son of a mechanic in a country town where 
                pragmatism far outweighed book smart, I had to grow up quickly, and learn to not standout.

                Primary school was easy and did not prepare me for highschool in the ways that matter. I attended a relatively poor state school for grades 1 to 7. I was an average
                white child in a school full of children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. My average backround actually put me in the 'top percentile' and set me up for a false sense
                of security. My parents decided that going to the local Catholic highschool was best for giving me a well rounded education and the best head start in life. 
                Little did they know, sending me to the private highschool would only create insecurities and fuel an insatiable hunger for me to do better than those around me. 
                Is this what my parents intended? Probably not, but here we are. I over invest, insist I can do it all, and I do not give up easily making me incredibly dogmatic.  
            </p>

            <p>
                After highschool, I went to university. I originally started university at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Queensland. I started studing pharmacy but after the 
                first few weeks, I knew it wasnt for me. I think I moved to Brisbane to get away from my family. It was a tough time being gay and having no role models. I had to figure
                it out by myself without the help of anyone else. Day by day I was working it out. Reconciling my sexuality with what I was taught to be right and wrong. I had to redefine
                my entire belief system. Morals and ethics of a small town are often limited by small minds and do not encapsulate wordly views outside the narrow scope of tourists passing
                through town.

                Then  I started engineering at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland. It was here that I met a really close friend. He was a different thinker. His ideas
                of what it meant to be a good person resonated with me. His approach to life was different -- refreshing. I owe a lot to Kevin. He was a springboard to the person I 
                am today. Through university we worked to get each other across the line and graduated together. Today he is a control systems engineer and is succeeding in ways that
                so many people doubted that he ever would. He smashed the glass ceiling that his family built for him. I know they love him, but he needed room to rebel and grow beyond
                what they thought was possible.

                After graduating university I moved to Darwin, Northern Territory to start as a graduate engineer at a company called Territory Generation. Territory Generation is the 
                largest power producer in the Northern Territory. I ended up working at almost all of their power stations across the Northern Territory. It was a unique experience and 
                I finished up there after two years being an EIC (electrical, instrumentation and controls) engineer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I ultimately ended up leaving Territory Generation because towards the end of my two year contract, I asked for clarity on whether or not they would be offering me a permanent
                position. My request was met with a lot of promises but no action. Unbeknownst to me, I had a few managers that believed so strongly in me, that they called a manager at the 
                network company, and vouched for me so strongly that they ended up offering me a position. That is when I changed from an EIC engineer to a power system engineer.     
            </p>

            <p>
                Working at Power and Water Corporation in the System Control division was eye openning. Both Power and Water and Territory Generation are both government owned corporations, 
                however Power and Water presented numerous 'government challenges'. These sorts of challenges are limited to government organisations where ancient, archaic policies are the 
                law of the land.
