            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <h2>Where I come from</h2>

            <p>
                I grew up in rural Queensland as the second son to a mechanic and a cleaner. In a small town built around
                sugar cane, mangoes, and cattle, practicality mattered more than appearances or abstract ideas. Things
                either worked or they didn't, and explanations were expected to survive contact with reality. That
                environment shaped how I think: competence mattered, excuses didn't, and credibility was earned by doing.
            </p>

            <p>
                That background left me instinctively sceptical of authority without understanding. I learned early that
                being “book smart” was only useful if it translated into something tangible, and that confidence without
                substance was quickly exposed. Those lessons stuck, and they still influence how I approach engineering
                problems today.
            </p>

            <h2>My path into engineering</h2>

            <figure>

            </figure>

            <p>
                I studied engineering with an initial focus on understanding how complex systems behave in the real
                world, not just on paper. Early in my career, I moved into site-based roles in power generation, working
                as an EIC (Electrical, Instrumentation and Control) engineer across a fleet of gas turbines and
                reciprocating engines.
            </p>

            <p>
                That time on site was formative. It meant working around operating plant, dealing with real constraints,
                and understanding how design decisions play out under pressure. It also meant learning quickly that
                neat theoretical answers often fall apart when exposed to operational reality.
            </p>

            <h2>From site work to power systems</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/about-powerstation-placeholder.jpg" alt="Power station or control room">
            </figure>

            <p>
                From there, my career shifted toward power system engineering and system-level studies. I moved into
                roles focused on network behaviour, generator integration, and system performance — including work in
                system control environments and later in consulting-style study roles.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work now spans both <strong>RMS</strong> and <strong>EMT</strong> studies, with a particular focus on
                grid connection support, generator performance standards (GPS), power quality, harmonics, and model
                validation. Alongside that, I spend a lot of time building automation tools — primarily in Python — to
                make studies repeatable, auditable, and less dependent on manual intervention.
            </p>

            <h2>How this shapes my thinking</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/about-analysis-placeholder.jpg" alt="Power system analysis and modelling">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Engineering, particularly in power systems, is often presented as either trivial or impossibly complex.
                In practice, most of the difficulty comes from missing context, unstated assumptions, and skipped steps
                in reasoning. Having worked across site operations, system control, and detailed studies, I've come to
                believe that good engineering is explainable.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a result can't be justified clearly — in plain language, with assumptions exposed — then it isn't
                finished. Software outputs are useful, but they are not truth on their own. They are hypotheses that
                still need engineering judgement applied.
            </p>

            <h2>Why this site exists</h2>

            <p>
                This site exists to make that reasoning explicit. I write about real engineering problems the way they
                are actually solved — by building intuition first, stating assumptions clearly, and focusing on what
                actually changes decisions in the real world.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you read this site, you should expect clear explanations, honest discussion of limitations, and
                engineering that is grounded in experience rather than mystique.
            </p>
