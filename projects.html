            <h1>My Projects</h1>

            <p>This part of my website is dedicated to breaking down detailed engineering concepts. The intention of each post is to guide my readers through my thought processes. 
                In doing so, I hope that the readers will be equipped with the correct theory, practical knowledge and skills to solve the same complex issues.
                I also intend to share how I create scripts to automate processes and acheive consistent solutions to all the engineering problems I solve.
