            <p>
                This part of my website is dedicated to breaking down detailed engineering concepts. The intention of each post is to guide my readers through my thought processes. 
                In doing so, I hope that the readers will be equipped with the correct theory, learned knowledge and skills to solve the same complex engineering issues.
                I also intend to share how I create scripts to automate processes and acheive consistent solutions for all the problems I solve.
